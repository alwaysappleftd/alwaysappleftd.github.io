  <h2>Everything about iCloud Bypass and iOS Unlocking</h2>
  <h3>What is an iCloud Bypass?</h3>
  <p>An iCloud bypass is basically the process of removing or circumventing the activation lock on an Apple device that is linked to an iCloud account. When an Apple device is locked with an iCloud account, it tells the user to enter their Apple ID and password to gain access to the device. However, in some cases, people may purchase a second-hand device that is still linked to the previous owners iCloud account, got scammed on eBay, or maybe someone might have just forgot their Apple ID and password. In such cases, an iCloud bypass can be used to gain access to the device without having to enter the original owners credentials.
There are various methods of iCloud bypass, most of which involve using software or utilizing glitches in the iOS system.</p>
  <h3>What is the Setup.app and how does deleting it work?</h3>
  <p>The Setup.app is a default system app on all Apple devices that allows users to set up and configure their device during the initial setup process. It is a built-in app that is pre-installed on all iDevices.
The Setup.app contains a series of setup screens that guide users through the setup process, such as connecting to Wi-Fi networks, signing in with an Apple ID, setting up Touch ID or Face ID, and other configuration options. It is an essential part of the iPhone setup process and ensures that the device is properly configured for use.</p>
  <p>--------------------------------------------------</p>

  <p>Deleting the Setup.app in an iCloud bypass refers to the process of removing the Setup application that runs when an Apple device is first activated. When an Apple device is locked with an iCloud account, the Setup.app can prevent the device from being used by a new user. Therefore, deleting the Setup.app can be a good step in the process to a successful iCloud bypass.
There are lots of softwares out there and of course they all claim to be the best for removing the Setup.app. But I would definitely advise you to be careful when choosing software to bypass your iDevice. Unfortunately, quite a few of these can be scams or just simply ask you to pay for a license or buy the bypass. But what these softwares are asking you to pay for can usually be found for free! Its also always best to only use software from trusted iCloud bypass developers and hackers.</p>
  <h3>What are some popular methods of bypassing the iCloud lock on iDevices?</h3>
  <p>1. Deleting the Setup.app: As explained earlier, deleting the Setup.app is a method of bypassing the iCloud lock on some Apple devices. This method works by removing the Setup.app from the iDevices filesystem, most times using an SSH connection into the devices root filesystem. Because this app is what shows the Activation Lock Screen, when the app is removed, the iDevice can no longer show that screen so it is forced to go directly to the Home screen.</p>
  <p>2. Using spoofed activation records: This method is popular on newer iOS versions (14 and up), because on most newer iOSs, the Setup.app is quite hard to remove. In most cases even if you completely delete the app from the root filesystem, the phone will just brick itself and be stuck on the Apple logo or a boot loop forcing you to restore to the latest iOS version. Using spoofed activation records involves injecting a spoofed activation certificate into the device so that it thinks that it has been activated successfully. Often, this method is a tethered bypass, meaning that if you reboot the device or the battery dies, you will have to simply preform the bypass again to re-enable it. But some new tools such as ByteBurst use the SSHRD_Script to SSH into the device via a ramdisk and bypass, making this method untethered.</p>
  <p>3. Using iOS Bugs in the Setup.app: This method is fairly unreliable, because most times it involves using complicated glitches in the iOS system. If done correctly, the user can gain access to the Home screen, but also keep in mind that using this method is mostly for older iOS versions (iOS 11 and older) because Apple has patched all these vulnerabilities over the years.</p>
  <p>4. iCloud DNS Bypass: This method involves inputting a DNS server into the WiFi settings on the WiFi page. When you attempt to activate the device and then click the Back button, the device then connects to a server that has access to some web functions such as YouTube or Google. Its important to note that this is not a full bypass, and that this type of bypass only enables some features of the web. It does not get you into any part of the iDevice or give access to the apps on the Home screen.</p>
  <h3>Why would anyone want to bypass the iCloud lock?</h3>
  <p>You might be wondering why so many people would want to bypass the iCloud lock.
Bypassing the iCloud activation lock can potentially allow you to access a device that you wouldn't otherwise be able to use. This can be very useful in situations where you've acquired an iDevice with an iCloud lock, can"t remember your iCloud password or if you've purchased a second-hand device from online that is locked to someone else's iCloud account. Additionally, if your device accidentally got locked after a software update, you may be able to recover some of the data on the device.</p>
