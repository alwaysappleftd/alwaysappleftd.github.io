    <h1>Helpful Hacks for iOS hacking and developing</h1>
    <h2>chmod +x *drag executable here*</h2>
    <p>This command is very useful in Terminal when trying to run an executable.</p>
    <p>For some weird reason, macOS sometimes thinks that an executable is a text document filled with weird code, treating it like a document.</p>
    <p>When this command is ran, it tells the system to check if the file is an executable, and then convert it if so.</p>
    <h2>killall iproxy</h2>
    <p>Have you ever run into the issue where your Mac says "bind(): Address already in use
Error creating socket for listen port 4444: Address already in use"?</p>
    <p>I have run into this annoying issue many times and it simply means that iproxy needs to be quit before it can be used again.</p>
    <p>When running this command, it kills iproxy so that it isn't running anymore.</p>
    <p>Now, you can run iproxy again just like normal!</p>
    <h2>./idevicediagnostics shutdown</h2>
    <p>If you have the idevicediagnostics executable on your computer (you will most likely have it if you work with iCloud bypasses and hacks) </p>
    <p>and you have a device with a cracked screen or a broken power button, then this command is for you!</p>
    <p>This command is super useful when can't shut down your device for these reasons. </p>
    <p>Go and open up a new Terminal, cd into the directory that the idevicediagnostics executable is is, and paste this command in. </p>
    <p>Your device should shut down immediately!</p>
    <h2>./irecovery -n</h2>
    <p>This one can be very useful at times when a device is bricked in Recovery Mode.</p>
    <p>Half of the time, if your device is stuck in Recovery Mode, it is because the software on the device is corrupted, or there is something wrong with the device.</p>
    <p>But fairly often, all the device needs is a little reminder that it's can still boot up fine without an entire restore.</p>
    <p>The only requirement is that you have the irecovery executable on your Mac, which most people working with hacks and bypasses should have.</p>
    <p>Using this helpful little command, you can often fix your Recovery Mode issue without a full restore, which in most cases would wipe your data.</p>
    <p>Remember to cd into the directory with irecovery before pasting it into the Terminal.</p>
    <h2>sudo killall -STOP usbd</h2>
    <p>This command may be one of the most helpful commands to me.</p>
    <p>Have you ever plugged your Apple device into your Mac and it just keeps charging, not-charging, charging, not-charging?</p>
    <p>This can get SO annoying after a while but with this simple fix, you should be all good in no time.</p>
    <h2>xattr -cr *drag application or executable here*</h2>
    <p>This command is very helpful if you are seeing the error "[Application name] is damaged. You should move it to the Trash".</p>
    <p>When you run the command in Terminal, along with dragging your executable or .app file into the window, you can fix this issue quickly and easily.</p>
    <h2>chmod 755 *drag shell script file here*</h2>
    <p>The command here is quite helpful if you see the error "permission denied" when running a shell script.</p>
    <p>When running this command with your script, it should fix the "permission denied" error.</p>
