  <h3>New ByteBurst iCloud Bypass tool!</h3>
  <p>Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/@MrCreator1">@MrCreator1 </a>creates new iCloud bypass tool for iOS 13.0 - 16.5.1!!</p>
  <p>This tool is fully functional on iOS 15 and 16, but at this point Mr. Creator is still developing the iOS 13 and 14 parts.</p>
  <p>I'm pretty sure that the iOS 13/14 parts will be up and running in no time though.</p>
  <p>The software costs $5 to register your your device, and you can follow the steps on his website <a href="https://euphoriatools.com/byteburst/register.php">Here.</a></p>
  <p>Photo I took myself so no credit this time :)</p>

  <h3>New FrostByte iCloud Bypass tool!</h3>
  <p>Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/@MrCreator1">@MrCreator1 </a>creates new UNTETHERED iCloud bypass tool for iOS 15.0 - 16.5!!</p>
  <p>This tool is able to bypass Apple's new server-side patch when preforming it's unlock process.</p>
  <p>PLEASE NOTE: Mr. Creator is now considering FrostByte extinct, so it does not function anymore.</p>
  <p>There will not be a final version, and even if you find a copy on the internet, </p>
  <p>the software can no longer generate the activation files for your device because 
he has removed the server.</p>
  <p>If you would like to, you can check out Mr. Creator's new tool ByteBurst.</p>
  <p>It runs exactly the same as FrostByte, but it is a paid software. The registration costs $5 per device.</p>

  <p>Make sure you have a <a href="https://shorturl.at/dhnCY">USB OTG Lightning to USB-A</a> plugged into your iPhone, and simply connect the two phones together with a normal Apple USB charging cord.</p>
  <p>NOTES TO KEEP IN MIND: Make sure you are using the Apple cord with the USB-A end and not the new one with the USB-C end, </p>
  <p>Also make sure that you are using a checkm8-compatible device which are the iPhone 5s to iPhone X.</p>
  <p>This method will also work fine with iPads and iPod Touches with the A7 to A11 processor.</p>
  <p>Just make sure you are in DFU mode before pressing the button in LiNUZE!</p>
