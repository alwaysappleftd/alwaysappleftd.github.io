  	<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>

  	<p>I started working on technology in 2020 when I was 10 years old. That was the year that the pandemic came along and I had no school so I spent lots of my free time repairing old phones. Once I mastered taking them apart and fixing issues, I then moved on to working and learning all about software and hacks. I feel like I have come so far in these past years!</p>
